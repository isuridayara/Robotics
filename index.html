        <h1>Hello, I'm Dayara 👩‍💻</h1>
        
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an IT student with a strong interest in technology, programming, and embedded systems. 
            I enjoy working on Arduino projects, experimenting with electronics, and building interactive systems 
            that combine hardware and software. My goal is to continue developing my technical skills and 
            explore innovative solutions in the field of engineering and computing.
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction to Robotics</h2>
        <p>
            Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that combines computer science, electronics, mechanical engineering, 
            and artificial intelligence to design and build intelligent machines. Robots are used in many industries 
            including manufacturing, healthcare, space exploration, and education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Robotics systems typically include sensors (to collect data), controllers (such as microcontrollers or computers), 
            actuators (motors and servos), and software that enables decision-making. With the advancement of AI and automation, 
            robotics continues to grow rapidly and plays a vital role in modern technology.
